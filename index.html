    <div class="display-4 text-right rWall">Web Developer</div>
    <p class="text-right pRight text" align="right">Starting from 1989 when Tim Burners Lee invented the internet using the HTML language and web developing began. Using such languages as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Styling Sheets), JavaScript and its frameworks, and C# with it's numerious different frameworks. More commonly we developers are not building internet sites but are assigned to build intranet sites. Not to be confused with a web designer who has the job of building the front-end of a web page, a web devloper works with the back end or server-side of the application. Their process of building web applications follows a design pattern around the methods such as dynamic CRUD (create, read, update, destroy) to be able to obtain information and do so safely. Usually only requiring an associate degree, web developers don't need a lot of schooling but more experience. The average salery of a web developer is $80k each year.</p>

    <div class="display-4 lWall">Software Engineer</div>
    <p class="text pLeft">What is it that a software engineer does? Ever wonder how your computers operating system was built, or who is behind the creation of your phones os (Operating System)? Starting in the late 1960's, the spark of software applications began after the realease of the IMB 360 os. Software Developers create, update, and maintain programs/operating systems to constantly at the peak of preformance. These applications that they build can either be stand alone or be used to work hand in hand with other applications. For example, with such items as a VPN or even a server booster that works like the cores in a computer. These applications usualy done now in the language python but can also be done in any object-oriented programing/scripting language such as Java or c++. In the design/development process of an application, developers often follow the rule of functionality to design. Reason being is that it's a lot easier to fix a design layout/color issue than it is to fix a failing system error. The average salery for a software Engineer is $100k each year.</p>

    <div class="display-4 text-right rWall">Data Scientist</div>
    <p class="text-right pRight text" align="right">Of all of the positions for coding, a data scientist is the newest to cause a spark sense 2010. The demand for a data scientist sparked with the scare of the term "Big Data". The term refering to the massive amount of data to compute into complex mathmatical algoritums. A perfect example of one of these algoritums would be the google search engine. Starting all the way back in 1962 when John W. Turkey, a data anlysist, predicted the importance of data analytics in a programed computer. Data scientist will have to know programing languages such as python and how to create very detailed and complex algoritums with them, but often they use SQL (Structured Query Language) to help make sure they're asking for the right data. Commonly the amount of education needed can vary from either a 4-6 year degree, certification programs, and coding bootcamps. The average salary for a data scientist is $120k each year.</p>

    <div class="display-4 lWall">Database Developer</div>
    <p class="text pLeft">Begining in the 1960's the first large scale database had been created by IBM called SABRE and was used to help American Airlines reserve flights. Then moving into 1974-1977 the spark of relational databases were created by no other than IBM themselves. Now a days databases are within every company and now become unoticed, but it's the database developers who really hold it all together. By either running a NoSQL, SQL, Acess database, etc. Database developers are putting together the bones and structure on how they get formated and layed out. Database developers have to Know and understand the targeted information that they're after and what keys to target with relational databases. Most often to land this postion all that is required is an associates degreee and a certification in the CIS field. The average salery for a Database Developer is $70k each year.</p>
